  about: `
Data Scientist and AI Engineer with expertise in building production-grade RAG systems and agentic AI solutions. Currently developing financial document processing systems at FLX AI and HPC-integrated chatbots at University of Rochester's Center for Integrated Research Computing.

Background in computer vision research and distributed machine learning with strong foundation in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud technologies. Passionate about creating AI solutions that solve real-world problems in finance, research computing, and enterprise automation.

One of my key projects, [FinRAG3](https://github.com/prwt/finrag3), is a 6-phase agentic AI system that processes SEC filings and fund prospectuses with 95% accuracy, reducing analysis time from hours to 5 minutes. I've also developed [Steam Insights](https://github.com/prwt/steam-insights), a comprehensive gaming market analysis system processing 8M+ data points with ML forecasting.

Let's connect and collaborate on cutting-edge AI solutions!
